        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This kunafa, or knafeh, recipe is a favorite Palestinian dessert. 
           Crunchy shredded phyllo dough is baked with a layer of creamy sweet 
           cheese and then drenched in rosewater syrup. It's simple yet 
           impressive. The cheese filling is traditionally made from Nabulsi 
           cheese that is desalted. The ricotta-mozzarella mix is a great 
           substitute, and lower-fat products can be used. If you have access 
           to a Middle Eastern grocery, you can probably find kanafa dye, 
           which turns the dough into the orange or reddish color that is the 
           signature of kunafa.</p>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
             <li class="two">1 (16 ounce) box shredded phyllo dough (kataifi)</li>
             <li class="two">1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
             <li class="two">Mascarpone</li>
             <li class="two">1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
             <li class="two">â…“ cup white sugar</li>
             <li class="two">12 ounces unsalted butter</li>
             <li class="two">Rose water</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Directions</h2>
         <h3>Step 1:</h3>
         <blockquote>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</blockquote>
         <h3>Step 2:</h3>
         <blockquote>Finely chop frozen, shredded phyllo dough using a food processor
             until the strands are about the size of a grain of rice. Pour into a 
             large mixing bowl.</blockquote>
         <h3>Step 3:</h3>
         <blockquote>Mix together ricotta, mozzarella, and sugar in a separate bowl.</blockquote>
         <h3>Step 4:</h3>
         <blockquote>Place butter in a large, microwave-safe liquid measuring cup or 
            bowl with a spout. Heat in a microwave until completely melted, and let 
            it sit for several minutes until a thick white foam has formed on top. 
            Clarify butter by using a spoon to skim off the foam.</blockquote>
         <h3>Step 5:</h3>
         <blockquote>Carefully pour butter into the bowl of phyllo dough. Avoid 
            pouring in the white milk solids at the bottom of the clarified butter. 
            Use your hands to mix butter and dough together. Make sure butter is 
            absorbed by taking handfuls of the dough and rubbing it between 
            your palms.</blockquote>
         <h3>Step 6:</h3>
         <blockquote>Evenly spread buttered phyllo dough into a 9x13-inch pan and 
            firmly press it into the bottom and edges. Spread cheese mixture onto 
            the dough, avoiding the edges of the pan.</blockquote>
         <h3>Step 7:</h3>
         <blockquote>Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is slightly 
            golden and the edges of dough are brown and bubbly, 30 to 35 
            minutes.</blockquote>
         <h3>Step 8:</h3>
         <blockquote>While the kanafa is baking, prepare the syrup: 
            Combine 1 cup sugar and water in a small saucepan. Bring the mixture 
            to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and stir 
            in lemon juice. Simmer, stirring constantly, until the sugar is 
            dissolved and the mixture is thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Be careful 
            not to let the mixture turn golden and caramelize. 
            Remove from heat and add rose water; set aside.</blockquote>
         <h3>Step 9:</h3>
         <blockquote>Remove kanafa from the oven. Place a large platter or baking 
            sheet over the baking dish. Using oven mitts, carefully invert the baking 
            dish onto the platter so phyllo is on top. Pour syrup over kanafa. Cut into
            pieces and serve while hot.</blockquote>

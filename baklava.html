        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1 - Layer phyllo with nuts:</h3>
        <blockquote>Stack eight sheets of phyllo dough, brushing with butter 
            between each layer, to create a sturdy base. Sprinkle it with a 
            mixture of chopped nuts and cinnamon. Top with two sheets of phyllo 
            dough and follow with the nut mixture. Repeat this process a few more 
            times, until the nut mixture is gone. Top with about eight more 
            layers of phyllo, buttering each layer.</blockquote>
        <h3>Step 2 - Cut and bake:</h3>
        <blockquote>Cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes. 
            Be sure to cut all the way to the bottom of the pan. Bake until 
            golden and crisp.</blockquote>
        <h3>Step 3 - Finish with syrup:</h3>
        <blockquote>Boil water and sugar until sugar is melted. 
            Add vanilla and honey. Remove the baklava from the oven and 
            immediately pour syrup over it. Let cool before serving.</blockquote>
